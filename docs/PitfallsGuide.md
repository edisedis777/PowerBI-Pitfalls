# Power BI Pitfalls: Examples and Best Practices

This document expands on the top 5 Power BI pitfalls, using the `SalesData.csv` dataset to provide practical examples of what to avoid and how to improve your Power BI projects.

## Pitfall 1: Inefficient Data Modeling

### Explanation
Loading all data into a single table without proper modeling leads to redundancy, larger file sizes, and slower performance. A star schema with separate dimension and fact tables is more efficient.

### Wrong Way
- **Approach**: Import `SalesData.csv` as a single table without splitting customer and sales data.
- **Issue**: Duplicate customer information for each transaction increases file size and slows down queries.

### Right Way
- **Approach**: Split the data into `DimCustomer` (unique customer info) and `FactSales` (transaction data) with a relationship on `UniqueID`.
- **Benefit**: Reduces redundancy and improves query performance.

### Code
See `TransformSalesData.m` for Power Query scripts.

### Visual Demonstration
1. **Wrong Way**: Create a table visual with all columns from the single table to show redundancy (e.g., repeated `FirstName` for each `UniqueID`).
2. **Right Way**: Use the star schema and create a table with `DimCustomer[FirstName]` and `FactSales[TotalAmount]` to show efficient data usage.

## Pitfall 2: Poor DAX Usage

### Explanation
Inefficient or incorrect DAX measures can lead to slow reports or misleading results.

### Example 1: Filtering Sales
- **Wrong Way**: `Sales of Slippers Wrong`
  - Uses `FILTER`, which iterates over the entire table unnecessarily.
  - Slower performance, especially with large datasets.
- **Right Way**: `Sales of Slippers`
  - Uses `CALCULATE` with a direct filter, leveraging Power BIâ€™s engine for efficiency.

### Example 2: Average Sales
- **Wrong Way**: `Average Transaction Amount`
  - Calculates the average of individual transactions, not per customer.
- **Right Way**: `Average Sales per Customer`
  - Averages total sales per customer correctly using `AVERAGEX`.

### Visual Demonstration
1. Create two card visuals:
   - One with `Sales of Slippers Wrong`.
   - One with `Sales of Slippers`.
2. Use **Performance Analyzer** to compare query times.
3. Add a table visual with `DimCustomer[UniqueID]`, `Average Transaction Amount`, and `Average Sales per Customer` to highlight the difference.

## Pitfall 3: Poor Visualization Choices

### Explanation
Choosing inappropriate visuals can make reports hard to interpret or misleading.

### Example: Visualizing Purchase Types
- **Wrong Way**: Pie chart with all `PurchaseType` values.
  - Too many slices make it unreadable.
- **Right Way**: Bar chart with top 5 `PurchaseType` by sales.
  - Clear and focused on key data.

### Visual Demonstration
1. **Wrong Way**:
   - Add a pie chart.
   - Set `PurchaseType` as the legend and `Total Sales` as the value.
   - Observe the cluttered result.
2. **Right Way**:
   - Add a bar chart.
   - Set `PurchaseType` on the axis, `Total Sales` as the value.
   - Sort descending and apply a **Top N Filter** (Top 5 by `Total Sales`).

## Pitfall 4: Not Optimizing for Performance

### Explanation
Poor design choices, like complex DAX or excessive calculated columns, degrade report performance.

### Example: Calculating Total Sales
- **Wrong Way**: `Total Sales Slow`
  - Uses `SUMX` to multiply `Price` and `Stuckzahl` row-by-row, ignoring `TotalAmount`.
  - Slow due to unnecessary calculations.
- **Right Way**: `Total Sales Fast`
  - Uses the pre-calculated `TotalAmount` column for efficiency.

### Visual Demonstration
1. Create two card visuals:
   - One with `Total Sales Slow`.
   - One with `Total Sales Fast`.
2. Use **Performance Analyzer** to compare load times and show the performance difference.

## Pitfall 5: Inadequate Testing

### Explanation
Failing to validate calculations can lead to errors, especially with edge cases or filters.

### Example: Validating Average Sales
- **Wrong Way**: Using `Total Sales` divided by total customers without checking for sales activity.
  - Includes customers with no sales, skewing results.
- **Right Way**: `Validated Avg Sales per Customer`
  - Uses `CustomersWithSales` to ensure only active customers are counted.

### Visual Demonstration
1. Create a table visual with:
   - `DimCustomer[UniqueID]`.
   - `Total Sales per Customer`.
   - `Validated Avg Sales per Customer`.
2. Add a slicer for `PurchaseType` and test edge cases (e.g., filter to a rare `PurchaseType` to ensure calculations hold).

## Conclusion
By applying these best practices, you can avoid common Power BI pitfalls, ensuring your reports are efficient, accurate, and user-friendly.
